      <h2>The Strip</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">Washington Street &mdash; the heart of student life in Stillwater</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you were a student at Oklahoma State in the 1980s, The Strip was your living room. Located south
      of campus on Washington Street, this stretch of bars, restaurants, and gathering spots was the
      epicenter of the college social scene. Game nights, late nights, weeknights &mdash; The Strip was
      always alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doug, you know these places. Some of them are still open. Some are gone. But they were all part of
      your years in Stillwater.

        <h4 style="color: #fff;">Eskimo Joe's</h4>
        <div class="place-detail">Opened July 21, 1975 &bull; Still open today</div>
        <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
          Steve File and Stan Clark opened Eskimo Joe's as a bar in 1975. Then in <strong>1984</strong>,
          Oklahoma raised the drinking age from 18 to 21 &mdash; and everything changed. Joe's pivoted,
          adding a full restaurant component that became hugely successful.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
          Doug, you were there for that transition. You started college when you could drink at 18,
          and watched the law change underneath you. By 1984, Stillwater Bay Oyster Company opened
          as a more upscale option, and by 1987, Mexico Joe's rounded out the trio.
          The Eskimo Joe's t-shirt became one of the most recognizable in America.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card" style="background: #222; border-color: var(--osu-orange);">
        <h4 style="color: #fff;">Willie's Saloon</h4>

        <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
          Willie's was <em>the</em> place in the late '80s &mdash; $0.25 pitchers of beer, live music,
          and an atmosphere you couldn't find anywhere else. But the real story? <strong>A kid named Garth Brooks
          had a regular Wednesday night gig here from 1981 to 1985</strong>, playing covers of Dan Fogelberg,
          Don McLean, and Neil Young for a bar full of students who had no idea they were watching a
          future country music legend.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
          Doug, you overlapped with Garth at OSU for three years.

      <div class="place-card" style="background: #222; border-color: var(--osu-orange);">
        <h4 style="color: #fff;">Coney Island</h4>

        <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
          Owned by Mike Edwards since 1969, Coney Island was already a Stillwater institution when Doug
          arrived. Simple food, reliable quality, a campus staple.

      <div class="place-card" style="background: #222; border-color: var(--osu-orange);">

        <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
          Founded by OSU alumnus Robert Dermer in 1957, The Hideaway moved to its current
          location on Knoblock Street in 1980 &mdash; just two years before Doug arrived.
          A pizza and beer institution.

          Gayla Higgins opened this comfort-style diner during the '80s, and it became a Stillwater

          Began as a restaurant in 1974, converted to a bar in '75, and by 1986 had evolved into
          full food, beer, and liquor service. Another Strip landmark.

    <div class="garth-box">
      <h3>The Garth Brooks Connection</h3>
      <p>
        This might be the wildest detail in this entire time capsule: <strong>Garth Brooks attended
        Oklahoma State from 1981 to 1985</strong>. He earned a degree in marketing (or advertising,
        depending on the source). He was a javelin thrower on the track team. He worked as a bouncer
        at the Tumbleweed Dancehall &amp; Concert Venue. And every Wednesday night, he played covers
        at Willie's Saloon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doug arrived at OSU in 1982. Garth was a sophomore. For three years, they walked the same campus,
        ate at the same restaurants, and were in the same town. Garth left for Nashville in 1987 and
        became the best-selling solo artist in U.S. history.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: 600; color: var(--osu-orange); margin-bottom: 0;">
        He met his first wife, Sandy Mahl, at the Tumbleweed in the early 1980s &mdash; while Doug was a student.

      <h2>Traditions</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">The things that made OSU feel like home</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block">
      <h3>"America's Greatest Homecoming Celebration"</h3>
      <p>
        It started as a small harvest carnival in 1913 and evolved into what Oklahoma State calls
        "America's Greatest Homecoming Celebration." The first official Homecoming wasn't until 1920,
        when the Alumni Association hosted it. By the time Doug was on campus, it was a massive
        annual tradition that brought thousands of alumni back to Stillwater.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block">
      <h3>The Walkaround</h3>
      <p>
        A gigantic block party centered around Homecoming decorations. City streets close down.
        Thousands of alumni return to view the elaborate Greek house decorations, enjoy food,
        music, and reconnect with student organizations. OSU is one of the only schools left
        in the nation with an event like the Walkaround.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every year, fraternities and sororities work for weeks to create their house decorations,
        showcasing pride for the university and that year's theme. It's competitive, it's creative,
        and it's uniquely OSU.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block">
      <h3>The Drinking Age Change</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most significant social shifts during Doug's years: in <strong>1984</strong>, Oklahoma
        raised the legal drinking age from 18 to 21. Doug started college when freshmen could legally drink.
        By his junior year, that was gone. It reshaped the entire social landscape of The Strip &mdash;
        bars like Eskimo Joe's had to reinvent themselves, adding food service to survive.
        It was the end of one era and the start of another.
