        <p class="bio-subtitle">The Iron Duke of Defense</p>
        <p class="bio-dates">August 6, 1904 &mdash; January 15, 1993 &bull; Easton, Missouri</p>
        <p>
          For 36 years, Hank Iba prowled the sidelines at Oklahoma A&amp;M (later Oklahoma State),
          building a basketball dynasty rooted in iron discipline and suffocating defense.
          He won 751 games. He won two national championships. He coached three Olympic teams.
          And when he died, they held his funeral in the arena that bears his name.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block">
      <h3>The Path to Stillwater</h3>
      <p>
        Born in the small town of Easton, Missouri, Iba began coaching at Classen High School in
        Oklahoma City before moving to the collegiate level. His career took him through
        Northwest Missouri State (1929&ndash;1933) and the University of Colorado (1933&ndash;1934)
        before he arrived at Oklahoma A&amp;M in <strong>1934</strong> &mdash; where he would stay
        for the rest of his coaching career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond basketball, Iba served as athletic director from 1935 to 1970 and was even the school's
        head baseball coach from 1934 to 1941, compiling a 90&ndash;41 record on the diamond.
        But it was basketball where he made history.

      <p class="text-light-80">
        In 1945 and 1946, Iba's Oklahoma A&amp;M Aggies became the <strong>first team in NCAA history
        to win consecutive national championships</strong>. The weapon: 7-foot center
        <strong>Bob Kurland</strong> &mdash; the game's first dominant big man and the first
        two-time Most Outstanding Player in NCAA Tournament history.

          After the 1945 championship, the Aggies faced DePaul and their star George Mikan in the
          Red Cross Benefit Game &mdash; a matchup billed as the clash of the game's two dominant
          big men. Kurland and Iba's squad won, cementing their place as the best team in the country.
        </p>
        <p class="text-light-80">
          The 1946 title defense was emphatic. Iba's teams weren't flashy &mdash; they were methodical,
          disciplined, and utterly suffocating on defense. That formula worked better than anyone else's.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <p>
          Iba's defining innovation was the <strong>"swinging gate" defense</strong> &mdash; a man-to-man
          system with team flow that emphasized physical play and teammates helping each other. It wasn't
          just about guarding your man. It was about denying passes, disrupting rhythm, and making every
          possession a battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results speak for themselves: Iba's teams led the nation in scoring defense
          <strong>16 times during his first 23 seasons</strong> at Stillwater. Sixteen times. That's not
          a streak &mdash; that's a way of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          On offense, Iba ran a motion system built around a passing game with approximately 50 plays.
          If the pattern was executed correctly, someone was guaranteed an open shot. In close games,
          he deployed the famous <strong>"Iba deep freeze"</strong> &mdash; a ball-control strategy
          that prioritized possession over points.

        <p>
          Iba became the first coach in U.S. Olympic basketball history to lead a gold medal-winning team.
          The Americans dominated the tournament, and Iba's defensive system translated perfectly
          to the international game.

        <p>
          The most controversial finish in Olympic basketball history. In the gold medal game against
          the Soviet Union, the United States appeared to have won by one point. Then a courtside
          Olympic official <strong>twice ordered three seconds put back on the clock</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the <strong>third playing</strong> of the final seconds, the Soviets made a disputed basket
          and won 51&ndash;50 &mdash; breaking Team USA's <strong>63-game Olympic winning streak</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Iba's approval, the U.S. team <strong>boycotted the medal ceremony</strong>.
          The silver medals from that game <strong>remain unclaimed to this day</strong>, stored in the
          Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. No American player from that team has ever accepted
          their medal.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: 600; color: var(--osu-orange-dark);">
