      Doug, you picked one of the best possible seven-year windows to be at Oklahoma State. When you
      arrived in 1982, Jimmy Johnson was the head coach. When you graduated in 1988, Barry Sanders had
      just put up the greatest individual season in college football history and won the Heisman Trophy.
      In between, you watched two future Pro Football Hall of Famers line up in the same backfield.

        In 1988, Barry Sanders did something that had never been done and hasn't been done since.
        As a junior, after spending two years as Thurman Thomas's backup, Sanders exploded for
        <strong>2,628 rushing yards and 37 touchdowns in just 11 regular-season games</strong>.
        He set 34 NCAA records. He scored at least two touchdowns in every single game. He had five
        consecutive 200-yard games.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cowboys posted 40+ points in each of their first seven games. Sanders averaged 8.3 yards
        per carry. He produced 3,250 all-purpose yards. It wasn't just the best season of the year &mdash;
        it was the best season anyone had ever seen.
      </p>

      <h4>The Heisman</h4>
      <p>
        Sanders won the Heisman Trophy in a landslide, receiving 559 first-place votes compared to 70 for
        USC's Rodney Peete and 31 for UCLA's Troy Aikman. He swept all six voting regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The twist: Sanders learned he'd won the Heisman <strong>via satellite from Tokyo, Japan</strong>,
        where the team was preparing to face Texas Tech in the Coca-Cola Classic.
      </p>

      <h4>The Holiday Bowl Finale</h4>
      <p>
        As if the regular season wasn't enough, Sanders added <strong>222 rushing yards and 5 touchdowns</strong>
        in the Holiday Bowl against Wyoming (Oklahoma State 62, Wyoming 14). His final season totals:
        <strong>2,850 rushing yards, 42 rushing touchdowns, 44 total touchdowns</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was selected 3rd overall in the 1989 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. He's been inducted into
        both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

            running backs played on the same team &mdash; and one was sitting on the bench.

          <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
            Thomas was the starter from 1984 to 1987. He finished as Oklahoma State's all-time leading rusher
            with <strong>4,847 career yards and 43 touchdowns</strong>. He was a two-time All-American
            (1985 and 1987), with 1,600+ yards and 15+ touchdowns in both of those seasons.

          <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
            Drafted in the second round by the Buffalo Bills in 1988, Thomas went on to a 13-year NFL career
