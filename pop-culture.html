      <h2>Music &amp; MTV</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">The MTV revolution changed everything &mdash; and you lived through it</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      MTV launched on August 1, 1981 &mdash; one year before Doug arrived at OSU. By 1982, it had
      completely transformed how people consumed music. Music videos weren't just promotional tools anymore;
      they were the art form. And the artists who mastered the medium became the biggest stars on the planet.
    </p>

    <div class="culture-grid">
      <div class="culture-item">
        <h4>Michael Jackson</h4>
        <div class="culture-year">Thriller &bull; 1982</div>
        <p>The biggest-selling artist of the decade. Nine #1 singles. Thriller sold 25 million copies in the '80s alone. The moonwalk. The red jacket. He broke MTV's color barrier.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="culture-item">
        <h4>Prince</h4>
        <div class="culture-year">Purple Rain &bull; 1984</div>
        <p>Along with Jackson, Prince was among the first Black artists in heavy MTV rotation. Purple Rain was both the album and the movie. Genius on every instrument.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="culture-item">
        <h4>The Police</h4>
        <div class="culture-year">"Every Breath You Take" &bull; 1983</div>
        <p>The summer of 1983 belonged to The Police. That song made them the biggest band in the world. Then they broke up.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="culture-item">
        <h4>Bon Jovi</h4>
        <div class="culture-year">Slippery When Wet &bull; 1986</div>
        <p>20+ million copies sold. "Livin' on a Prayer" and "You Give Love a Bad Name." Then New Jersey (1988) sold another 10 million. Arena rock at its peak.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="culture-item">
        <h4>Whitney Houston</h4>
        <div class="culture-year">Seven Consecutive #1 Hits &bull; 1985&ndash;1988</div>
        <p>The only artist ever to score seven consecutive #1 songs, from "Saving All My Love for You" to "Where Do Broken Hearts Go."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="culture-item">
        <h4>The British Invasion II</h4>
        <div class="culture-year">1982&ndash;1984</div>
        <p>Duran Duran, A Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club, Human League. MTV made them superstars overnight. Synth-pop took over American radio.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout mt-3">
      <h3>The Walkman &amp; the Mixtape</h3>
      <p>
        The Sony Walkman (introduced 1979) and the cassette tape were your personal music delivery system.
        You clipped the Walkman to your belt, popped in a cassette, and created your own private world
        with foam headphones. And the mixtape? That was how you shared music &mdash; and maybe told someone
        how you felt about them.

      <h2>Tech in the Dorms</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">No internet. No cell phones. Here's what you actually had.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      When Doug arrived at OSU in 1982, the dorms were filled with the click-clack of typewriters at night.
      By the time he graduated in 1988, that sound had mostly disappeared, replaced by the hum of early
      personal computers running WordPerfect. But the fundamental experience was analog: no email,
      no texting, no social media. If you wanted to talk to someone, you walked to their room or
      called them on the phone.
    </p>

    <div class="tech-item">
      <div class="tech-icon">&#9000;</div>
      <div>
        <h4>Typewriters to Computers</h4>
        <p>Universities set up rooms with rudimentary computers for writing papers using WordPerfect. By 1988, the typewriter era was ending on college campuses. The Apple II, Commodore 64, and IBM PC were changing everything.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
      <div class="tech-icon">&#127911;</div>
      <div>
        <h4>The Sony Walkman</h4>
        <p>Your personal music bubble. Pop in a cassette, slip on foam headphones, clip it to your belt. Whether on the bus, at the park, or studying late at night &mdash; the Walkman was your constant companion.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
      <div class="tech-icon">&#128252;</div>
      <div>
        <h4>Cassette Tapes &amp; Mixtapes</h4>
        <p>Cassettes powered everything: boomboxes, car stereos, and the sacred art of the mixtape. Recording songs off the radio. Painstakingly labeling each tape. It was the playlist before playlists existed.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
      <div class="tech-icon">&#128222;</div>
      <div>
        <h4>Answering Machines</h4>
        <p>The social media of the '80s. You'd come back to your dorm room and check the blinking light. Missed calls, messages from friends, managing FOMO &mdash; all through a little box with a tape inside.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
      <div class="tech-icon">&#128250;</div>
      <div>
        <h4>VHS &amp; VCRs</h4>
        <p>The ability to record TV shows and rent movies was revolutionary. Blockbuster Video opened its first store in 1985. Friday nights meant a trip to the video store.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
      <div class="tech-icon">&#128187;</div>
      <div>
        <h4>No Internet</h4>
        <p>Let that sink in. No email. No Google. No Wikipedia. Research meant going to the library. If you wanted to know something, you looked it up in an encyclopedia or asked someone who knew. Doug wrote his business degree papers and his master's thesis without a single web search.</p>
