        <p>
          If you watched Cowboys basketball in the 1980s, you experienced something most arenas couldn't replicate.
          Gallagher-Iba Arena was a pressure cooker &mdash; literally. Until the 1987 renovation, the building
          had <strong>no air conditioning</strong>. The heat from thousands of fans packed into steep, 34-degree-angle
          seating created a suffocating wall of orange that terrorized visiting teams for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arena earned its fearsome nickname during the Henry Iba era, when the combination of stifling defense
          on the court and stifling conditions in the stands made it one of the most hostile environments in college
          basketball. Opponents didn't just lose games there &mdash; they wilted.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>1987</strong>, the building underwent a major renovation. Air conditioning was finally installed,
          and the arena was officially renamed <strong>Gallagher-Iba Arena</strong> &mdash; honoring both wrestling
          coach Ed Gallagher and the legendary Hank Iba. Doug, you were there when that happened.

        <div class="coach-years">Head Coach 1979&ndash;1986</div>
        <p>
          Hansen coached at OSU for seven seasons, compiling a 107&ndash;89 record. His crowning achievement
          was the 1982&ndash;83 season: a 24&ndash;7 record, Big 8 Tournament championship, and the school's
          first NCAA Tournament appearance in 18 years. He was named Big 8 Coach of the Year in 1980&ndash;81.
        </p>
        <p>
          After several inconsistent seasons following the '83 breakthrough, Hansen's contract was not renewed
          after the 1985&ndash;86 season.

        <p>
          Hamilton's hiring was historic: he became the <strong>first African-American head coach
          in Big 8 Conference history</strong>. He came from Kentucky, where he had served as associate
          head coach under Eddie Sutton.
        </p>
        <p>
          The early years were a rebuild &mdash; his first team went 8&ndash;20. But Hamilton was laying
          groundwork, and his tenure saw the arrival of future NBA players like John Starks and Byron Houston.
          He compiled a 56&ndash;63 record before leaving for Miami.

        Oklahoma dominated the Big 8 in basketball during the mid-1980s, winning regular season titles

        Gallagher-Iba Arena.

        the powers, but Missouri, Iowa State, and Nebraska all had their moments. Oklahoma State's best
        conference finish during this stretch was the 1982&ndash;83 season, when they went 9&ndash;5 and
        finished tied for third.

        The conference would evolve into the Big 12 in 1996, adding four Texas schools. But during Doug's
        time, it was the Big 8 &mdash; eight schools, round-robin scheduling, and Saturday afternoons
        that meant everything.

        The seeds planted during Doug's years bore fruit. Eddie Sutton arrived in 1990 and transformed
        everything. Two Final Fours. 13 NCAA Tournament appearances. 368 wins. The court named in his honor.
        The full story of Iba and Sutton &mdash; the two coaches Doug mentioned by name &mdash; is waiting
        for you.
