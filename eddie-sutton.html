          Eddie Sutton was born in the tiny town of Bucklin, Kansas &mdash; 130 miles west of Wichita.
          His father worked as a mechanic, electrician, and plumber. He enrolled at Oklahoma A&amp;M
          and played guard under the legendary Hank Iba from 1955 to 1958. He called Iba his
          "second father." Then he spent the next four decades becoming one of the most successful
          coaches in college basketball history &mdash; 806 wins, four schools in the NCAA Tournament,
          and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.

      On April 11, 1990, Eddie Sutton returned to his alma mater. The program he inherited was in ruins:
      <strong>one NCAA Tournament appearance in 25 years</strong>. Only seven winning seasons in that same
      stretch. Oklahoma State basketball was an afterthought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutton changed that immediately.

      <h4>Year One: Instant Impact</h4>
      <p>
        In Sutton's first season (1990&ndash;91), the Cowboys went <strong>24&ndash;8</strong>, won the
        Big 8 regular season championship, and advanced to the NCAA's Sweet 16. Henry Iba &mdash;
        watching from Stillwater &mdash; couldn't have been happier.
      </p>

      <h4>The Three D's</h4>
      <p>
        Sutton's core principles were printed on the players' practice jerseys and shorts:
        <strong>Discipline, Dedication, and Defense</strong>. His teams excelled through a disciplined,
        defense-oriented style emphasizing rebounding and quick transition play, pressing to force
        turnovers and capitalize on fast breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        As assistant Charlie Spoonhour described it: "The deal was not just guarding your man,
        it was denial of passes, playing the passing lanes. It was perfected by the inch."

          that <strong>shattered the Kingdome backboard</strong>. Glass everywhere. The entire country saw it.
